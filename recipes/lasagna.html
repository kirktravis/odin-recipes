    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 (28 oz) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1.2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oreganon (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>        
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups dried malfada noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 
            5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, 
            onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until 
            sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water
             and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender 
             yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. 
            Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
        </li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and 
            preheat the oven's broiler.
        </li>
        <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until 
            cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
